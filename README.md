## Notes
- UI mockup is based on the provided wireframe screenshot.
- Click a ticker in the horizontal bar to focus a product; the order book and trades panels will automatically subscribe/unsubscribe.
- Order book grouping can be changed via the chips above the table; options depend on the symbol's price precision.
- Trade feed merges trades at the same price within 100 ms and provides rolling stats and a large‑trade threshold control.
- The application uses a single WebSocket connection to subscribe to multiple channels depending on the focused symbol.
